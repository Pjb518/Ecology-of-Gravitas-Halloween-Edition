Many a forest path leads to a cottage with smoke puffing from the chimney and a pie cooling on the sill: a green hag’s lair. In fact, many hags enjoy and excel in domestic arts such as baking, weaving, or keeping pigs or bees.

Some hags’ lairs stand on crossings between the material world and their native faerie realm.</p><p><strong><em>Homely Arts.</em></strong> Green hags only leave their lairs on ceremonial occasions, doing everything they can to make prey come to them. Many a forest path leads to a cottage with smoke puffing from the chimney and a pie cooling on the sill: a green hag’s lair. In fact, many hags enjoy and excel in domestic arts such as baking, weaving, or keeping pigs or bees. Hags delight in the macabre, and each of their hobbies has its horrific aspect: pies may contain humanoid flesh, pigs may be polymorphed trespassers, and a single snip of the hag’s shears may end the life of a creature under its power.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Baking gingerbread men.

Ecologies of Gravitas exists to help prevent that problem.</p>\n<p>An ecology of gravitas is a drag-and-drop module that’s a blend of expanded monster lore, mini-adventures, and custom encounter tables. This method helps Narrators emphasize storytelling and add weight to exploration. All the while, the stories and exploration encounters are centered on a single monstrous figure. The goal is to help players anticipate and engage with the creature well before initiative is even rolled.</p>\n<p>A single ecology of gravitas works well with almost any style of play. Used alongside a published adventure, an ecology can be used to add weight to one of the named characters in the adventure. Each ecology can also be expanded upon to suit your own storytelling needs—even into a unique sandbox adventure. In largescale sandbox campaigns, an effective option is to choose a small handful of ecologies per exploration region to add flavor—especially as each of the ecologies interact in unexpected ways.</p>\n<h2>Existential Threat Level</h2>\n<p>Creatures are rated in combat by their challenge rating. Yet creatures can present more of a threat than how they perform in combat. After all, rats can slay knights without ever declaring war. The existential threat a creature poses are rated in the following ways:</p>\n<p><strong>Treat 1 - Manageable.</strong> Threats which are manageable with well-known safety protocols (staying indoors at night, maintaining city walls, etc.). They typically are only a threat to people who venture into the wilds.</p>\n<p><em>Wolves, bandits, ropers, skeletons, oozes</em></p>\n<p><strong>Threat 2 - Invasive.</strong> Containment is unreliable. The entity has the means of passing common physical barriers and other containment measures.</p>\n<p><em>Rats, disease, ghosts, plague zombies, spies</em></p>\n<p><strong>Threat 3 - Society.</strong> The entity attacks the very fabric of society. These creatures typically have powers of illusion, mind-control, or the like.</p>\n<p><em>Vampires, rakrasha, angels, cults, mages</em></p>\n<p><strong>Threat 4 - Planetary.</strong> Threats against the natural order, or against reality itself. The world as we know it persists because these threats are pushed back by miracles, mighty heroes, and great sacrifices. Some exist in a dormant state—for now.</p>\n<p><em>Aberrations, demons, primordial elementals</em></p>\n<h2>Ecology Zones</h2>\n<p>Each ecology consists of five zones, each of which represents growing proximity to the featured creature. The creature’s renown score influences the actual range of their ecology zone. Generally, each zone has the following traits:</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 1: Rumor.</strong> The extent of the creature’s renown. The common folk know of the entity through rumor and hearsay, getting many details incorrect. Sages in the area may provide accurate–if limited—details.</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 2: Influence.</strong> The zone where the creature’s reality is felt, even at a distance. If the creature is a hunter, its hunting grounds often include this area. Ambiguous yet disturbing signs become more frequent and more undeniable.</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 3: Territory.</strong> A creature’s actively defended area, avoided by most other creatures except for the entity’s servants. Here, the entity can learn about, stalk, and terrorize intruders—sometimes even at range.</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 4: Presence.</strong> The lair of the entity, or the effect of being near the entity. The entity need not be aware of intruders for its auras, lair features, and collateral damage to present challenges to player characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 5: Encounter.</strong> The entity is aware of the PCs and can respond directly. The player characters must flee, negotiate, or fight for their lives.</p>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"The Green Witch","type":"text","_id":"TowpSMVhY7Za8ARj","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><strong>True Identity: </strong>Coven Green Hag</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating: </strong>5</p>\n<p><strong>Threat Level: </strong>3 (Society)</p>\n<p><strong>Prestige: </strong>4+ (Town and surroundings)</p>\n<p><strong>Environment: </strong>Woods and other wilderness</p>\n<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Alchemy, beast shape, divination, charms, cooking, compulsion, curses, flight (broom of flying), illusion, invisibility, and mimicry.</p>\n<p>The green witch is the subject of fear and speculation.

They use the statistics of skeletons, except they are Constructs instead of Undead.</p>\n<p><strong>Cursed Belongings.</strong> It is safe to use the green hag’s furniture, kitchenware, and appliances. However, leaving a mess or attempting to remove an object from the premises (including home goods, decorations, and rare materials) makes the creature immediately subject to the coven green hag’s Hex (even if out of range), automatically failing their saving throw.</p>\n<p><strong>Tea Leaves.</strong> Once per day, while drinking tea, the green hag can cast augury. She may choose to cast this spell on behalf of another creature. If both her coven sisters are present, once per day they can also work together to cast commune with nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Tempting Cooking.</strong> A Humanoid beginning or ending their turn next to green hag’s food is subject to a DC 13 Wisdom save (charm effect). On a fail, the creature must use its next action to eat the food. It is delicious, and confers an obligation to the hag.</p>\n<h2>Zone 5: Encounter</h2>\n<p>The hag’s full persona and life situation comes to the fore, and she involves those she happens upon accordingly. The encounter with her might include any of the factors from her territory or lair.

If the host has an alignment trait, 2 or 3 khalkos spawn burst out of the host’s skull after 1 round.</p><p><em>Greater restoration</em> or a similar spell cast with at least a 5th-level spell slot is required to kill the brain larvae and remove the disease.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or Religion check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> An ancient book, purportedly written by a refugee from another reality, describes a species of intelligent, wasp-like creatures that parasitically prey on angels and other planar beings.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A khalkos is a wasp-like aberration. It exudes a cloud of pheromones that maddens everyone nearby, and it implants creatures with skull-exploding larvae.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos. They conquer reality after reality, leaving behind deserted heavens and dead gods as they rob worlds of divine magic.</p><p>A khalkos is humanoid in shape with an inexpressive wasp face. It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae—now independent khalkos spawn—fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don’t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven’t discovered our reality yet.

khalkos starts combat by using Chaos Pheromones on clusters of enemies, and then uses Psionic Sting on either a creature with an alignment or a creature likely to fail an Intelligence saving throw. Once an enemy is stunned, the khalkos uses Brain Jab. The khalkos retreats once it has infected a target with brain larvae (possibly using <em>plane shift</em> if it hasn’t already today).</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DISEASE: BRAIN LARVAE</strong></h2><p>A khalkos can infect an intelligent creature with a horrifying disease, injecting khalkos larvae directly into the creature’s skull. While infected with this disease, the host undergoes the following changes:</p><p><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> The host gains telepathy out to a radius of 120 feet. Additionally, the host can telepathically communicate with the khalkos that infected it over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane.</p><p><strong><em>Trust.</em></strong> Whenever a khalkos makes a Charisma check to convince the host of its good intentions, it does so with advantage. If it succeeds, the host becomes friendly to it no matter its previous attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>After 10 (3d6) days, the host develops a splitting headache and is incapacitated for 24 hours. At the end of this time, the host dies. If the host has an alignment trait, 2 or 3 khalkos spawn burst out of the host’s skull after 1 round.</p><p><em>Greater restoration</em> or a similar spell cast with at least a 5th-level spell slot is required to kill the brain larvae and remove the disease.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or Religion check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> An ancient book, purportedly written by a refugee from another reality, describes a species of intelligent, wasp-like creatures that parasitically prey on angels and other planar beings.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A khalkos is a wasp-like aberration. It exudes a cloud of pheromones that maddens everyone nearby, and it implants creatures with skull-exploding larvae.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos. They conquer reality after reality, leaving behind deserted heavens and dead gods as they rob worlds of divine magic.</p><p>A khalkos is humanoid in shape with an inexpressive wasp face. It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae—now independent khalkos spawn—fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don’t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven’t discovered our reality yet.

khalkos starts combat by using Chaos Pheromones on clusters of enemies, and then uses Psionic Sting on either a creature with an alignment or a creature likely to fail an Intelligence saving throw. Once an enemy is stunned, the khalkos uses Brain Jab. The khalkos retreats once it has infected a target with brain larvae (possibly using <em>plane shift</em> if it hasn’t already today).</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DISEASE: BRAIN LARVAE</strong></h2><p>A khalkos can infect an intelligent creature with a horrifying disease, injecting khalkos larvae directly into the creature’s skull. While infected with this disease, the host undergoes the following changes:</p><p><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> The host gains telepathy out to a radius of 120 feet. Additionally, the host can telepathically communicate with the khalkos that infected it over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane.</p><p><strong><em>Trust.</em></strong> Whenever a khalkos makes a Charisma check to convince the host of its good intentions, it does so with advantage. If it succeeds, the host becomes friendly to it no matter its previous attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>After 10 (3d6) days, the host develops a splitting headache and is incapacitated for 24 hours. At the end of this time, the host dies. If the host has an alignment trait, 2 or 3 khalkos spawn burst out of the host’s skull after 1 round.</p><p><em>Greater restoration</em> or a similar spell cast with at least a 5th-level spell slot is required to kill the brain larvae and remove the disease.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or Religion check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> An ancient book, purportedly written by a refugee from another reality, describes a species of intelligent, wasp-like creatures that parasitically prey on angels and other planar beings.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A khalkos is a wasp-like aberration. It exudes a cloud of pheromones that maddens everyone nearby, and it implants creatures with skull-exploding larvae.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos. They conquer reality after reality, leaving behind deserted heavens and dead gods as they rob worlds of divine magic.</p><p>A khalkos is humanoid in shape with an inexpressive wasp face. It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae—now independent khalkos spawn—fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don’t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven’t discovered our reality yet.

khalkos starts combat by using Chaos Pheromones on clusters of enemies, and then uses Psionic Sting on either a creature with an alignment or a creature likely to fail an Intelligence saving throw. Once an enemy is stunned, the khalkos uses Brain Jab. The khalkos retreats once it has infected a target with brain larvae (possibly using <em>plane shift</em> if it hasn’t already today).</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DISEASE: BRAIN LARVAE</strong></h2><p>A khalkos can infect an intelligent creature with a horrifying disease, injecting khalkos larvae directly into the creature’s skull. While infected with this disease, the host undergoes the following changes:</p><p><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> The host gains telepathy out to a radius of 120 feet. Additionally, the host can telepathically communicate with the khalkos that infected it over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane.</p><p><strong><em>Trust.</em></strong> Whenever a khalkos makes a Charisma check to convince the host of its good intentions, it does so with advantage. If it succeeds, the host becomes friendly to it no matter its previous attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>After 10 (3d6) days, the host develops a splitting headache and is incapacitated for 24 hours. At the end of this time, the host dies. If the host has an alignment trait, 2 or 3 khalkos spawn burst out of the host’s skull after 1 round.</p><p><em>Greater restoration</em> or a similar spell cast with at least a 5th-level spell slot is required to kill the brain larvae and remove the disease.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or Religion check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> An ancient book, purportedly written by a refugee from another reality, describes a species of intelligent, wasp-like creatures that parasitically prey on angels and other planar beings.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A khalkos is a wasp-like aberration. It exudes a cloud of pheromones that maddens everyone nearby, and it implants creatures with skull-exploding larvae.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos. They conquer reality after reality, leaving behind deserted heavens and dead gods as they rob worlds of divine magic.</p><p>A khalkos is humanoid in shape with an inexpressive wasp face. It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae—now independent khalkos spawn—fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don’t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven’t discovered our reality yet.

It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae—now independent khalkos spawn—fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don’t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven’t discovered our reality yet.

khalkos starts combat by using Chaos Pheromones on clusters of enemies, and then uses Psionic Sting on either a creature with an alignment or a creature likely to fail an Intelligence saving throw. Once an enemy is stunned, the khalkos uses Brain Jab. The khalkos retreats once it has infected a target with brain larvae (possibly using <em>plane shift</em> if it hasn’t already today).</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DISEASE: BRAIN LARVAE</strong></h2><p>A khalkos can infect an intelligent creature with a horrifying disease, injecting khalkos larvae directly into the creature’s skull. While infected with this disease, the host undergoes the following changes:</p><p><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> The host gains telepathy out to a radius of 120 feet. Additionally, the host can telepathically communicate with the khalkos that infected it over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane.</p><p><strong><em>Trust.</em></strong> Whenever a khalkos makes a Charisma check to convince the host of its good intentions, it does so with advantage. If it succeeds, the host becomes friendly to it no matter its previous attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>After 10 (3d6) days, the host develops a splitting headache and is incapacitated for 24 hours. At the end of this time, the host dies. If the host has an alignment trait, 2 or 3 khalkos spawn burst out of the host’s skull after 1 round.</p><p><em>Greater restoration</em> or a similar spell cast with at least a 5th-level spell slot is required to kill the brain larvae and remove the disease.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or Religion check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> An ancient book, purportedly written by a refugee from another reality, describes a species of intelligent, wasp-like creatures that parasitically prey on angels and other planar beings.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A khalkos is a wasp-like aberration. It exudes a cloud of pheromones that maddens everyone nearby, and it implants creatures with skull-exploding larvae.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos. They conquer reality after reality, leaving behind deserted heavens and dead gods as they rob worlds of divine magic.</p><p>A khalkos is humanoid in shape with an inexpressive wasp face. It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae—now independent khalkos spawn—fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don’t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven’t discovered our reality yet.

Once an enemy is stunned, the khalkos uses Brain Jab. The khalkos retreats once it has infected a target with brain larvae (possibly using <em>plane shift</em> if it hasn’t already today).</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DISEASE: BRAIN LARVAE</strong></h2><p>A khalkos can infect an intelligent creature with a horrifying disease, injecting khalkos larvae directly into the creature’s skull. While infected with this disease, the host undergoes the following changes:</p><p><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> The host gains telepathy out to a radius of 120 feet. Additionally, the host can telepathically communicate with the khalkos that infected it over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane.</p><p><strong><em>Trust.</em></strong> Whenever a khalkos makes a Charisma check to convince the host of its good intentions, it does so with advantage. If it succeeds, the host becomes friendly to it no matter its previous attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>After 10 (3d6) days, the host develops a splitting headache and is incapacitated for 24 hours. At the end of this time, the host dies. If the host has an alignment trait, 2 or 3 khalkos spawn burst out of the host’s skull after 1 round.</p><p><em>Greater restoration</em> or a similar spell cast with at least a 5th-level spell slot is required to kill the brain larvae and remove the disease.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or Religion check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> An ancient book, purportedly written by a refugee from another reality, describes a species of intelligent, wasp-like creatures that parasitically prey on angels and other planar beings.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A khalkos is a wasp-like aberration. It exudes a cloud of pheromones that maddens everyone nearby, and it implants creatures with skull-exploding larvae.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos. They conquer reality after reality, leaving behind deserted heavens and dead gods as they rob worlds of divine magic.</p><p>A khalkos is humanoid in shape with an inexpressive wasp face. It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae—now independent khalkos spawn—fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don’t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven’t discovered our reality yet.

While infected with this disease, the host undergoes the following changes:</p><p><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> The host gains telepathy out to a radius of 120 feet. Additionally, the host can telepathically communicate with the khalkos that infected it over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane.</p><p><strong><em>Trust.</em></strong> Whenever a khalkos makes a Charisma check to convince the host of its good intentions, it does so with advantage. If it succeeds, the host becomes friendly to it no matter its previous attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>After 10 (3d6) days, the host develops a splitting headache and is incapacitated for 24 hours.

It exudes a cloud of pheromones that maddens everyone nearby, and it implants creatures with skull-exploding larvae.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos. They conquer reality after reality, leaving behind deserted heavens and dead gods as they rob worlds of divine magic.</p><p>A khalkos is humanoid in shape with an inexpressive wasp face. It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae—now independent khalkos spawn—fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don’t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven’t discovered our reality yet.

Ecologies of Gravitas exists to help prevent that problem.</p>\n<p>An ecology of gravitas is a drag-and-drop module that’s a blend of expanded monster lore, mini-adventures, and custom encounter tables. This method helps Narrators emphasize storytelling and add weight to exploration. All the while, the stories and exploration encounters are centered on a single monstrous figure. The goal is to help players anticipate and engage with the creature well before initiative is even rolled.</p>\n<p>A single ecology of gravitas works well with almost any style of play. Used alongside a published adventure, an ecology can be used to add weight to one of the named characters in the adventure. Each ecology can also be expanded upon to suit your own storytelling needs—even into a unique sandbox adventure. In largescale sandbox campaigns, an effective option is to choose a small handful of ecologies per exploration region to add flavor—especially as each of the ecologies interact in unexpected ways.</p>\n<h2>Existential Threat Level</h2>\n<p>Creatures are rated in combat by their challenge rating. Yet creatures can present more of a threat than how they perform in combat. After all, rats can slay knights without ever declaring war. The existential threat a creature poses are rated in the following ways:</p>\n<p><strong>Treat 1 - Manageable.</strong> Threats which are manageable with well-known safety protocols (staying indoors at night, maintaining city walls, etc.). They typically are only a threat to people who venture into the wilds.</p>\n<p><em>Wolves, bandits, ropers, skeletons, oozes</em></p>\n<p><strong>Threat 2 - Invasive.</strong> Containment is unreliable. The entity has the means of passing common physical barriers and other containment measures.</p>\n<p><em>Rats, disease, ghosts, plague zombies, spies</em></p>\n<p><strong>Threat 3 - Society.</strong> The entity attacks the very fabric of society. These creatures typically have powers of illusion, mind-control, or the like.</p>\n<p><em>Vampires, rakrasha, angels, cults, mages</em></p>\n<p><strong>Threat 4 - Planetary.</strong> Threats against the natural order, or against reality itself. The world as we know it persists because these threats are pushed back by miracles, mighty heroes, and great sacrifices. Some exist in a dormant state—for now.</p>\n<p><em>Aberrations, demons, primordial elementals</em></p>\n<h2>Ecology Zones</h2>\n<p>Each ecology consists of five zones, each of which represents growing proximity to the featured creature. The creature’s renown score influences the actual range of their ecology zone. Generally, each zone has the following traits:</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 1: Rumor.</strong> The extent of the creature’s renown. The common folk know of the entity through rumor and hearsay, getting many details incorrect. Sages in the area may provide accurate–if limited—details.</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 2: Influence.</strong> The zone where the creature’s reality is felt, even at a distance. If the creature is a hunter, its hunting grounds often include this area. Ambiguous yet disturbing signs become more frequent and more undeniable.</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 3: Territory.</strong> A creature’s actively defended area, avoided by most other creatures except for the entity’s servants. Here, the entity can learn about, stalk, and terrorize intruders—sometimes even at range.</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 4: Presence.</strong> The lair of the entity, or the effect of being near the entity. The entity need not be aware of intruders for its auras, lair features, and collateral damage to present challenges to player characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Zone 5: Encounter.</strong> The entity is aware of the PCs and can respond directly. The player characters must flee, negotiate, or fight for their lives.</p>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"The Khalkos Conspiracy","type":"text","_id":"3ezETOCo0cJZjC2G","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><strong>True Identity: </strong>Swarm led by one or more khalkos<br /><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> 9<br /><strong>Threat Level:</strong> 4 (Planetary)<br /><strong>Prestige:</strong> Varies (see Planetary Infection, below)<br /><strong>Environment: </strong>Major settlement, or site of magical power<br /><strong>Powers:</strong> Alignment detection, confusion, flight, infiltration, interplanar travel (plane shift), magic resistance, parasitoid infection and influence, telekinesis, telepathy, teleportation (teleportation circle), transformation (alter self)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Content Warning</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Many</em> Ecologoies of Gravitas<em> qualify as horror content, but that is especially the case for the khalkoi. This article comes with the following content warnings: </em>parasitism, mass graves, cult indoctrination, references to cancer and terminal illness, body horror, cosmic horror, apocalyptic horror, religious horror, unreality horror.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Devouring one reality after the next, the khalkoi have entered our plane of existence and plan to lay it waste from the inside out. The infection begins small, with only a few of the alien entities having burrowed their way into this plane from the cold void beyond. The khalkoi immediately set out to feed and to build their hive. Once the infection sets in, it takes a concerted effort from the entire local multiverse—mortals, gods, and demons alike—to drive out the foul parasites.</p>\n<p>This defense is inherently fraught, since gods, demons, and the like are the khalkoi’s favorite food. Khalkoi detect these creatures—and the cosmic alignment forces of Chaos, Evil, Good, and Law—as easily as a spider detects a fly in its web. Infecting and consuming these creatures is so nutritious for khalkoi that it even speeds their maturation rate. Thus, the more cosmically powerful enemies the khalkoi attract, the more rapidly they can expand their war efforts.</p>\n<h3>Site of Infection</h3>\n<p>Each khalkos conspiracy can be traced back to the single moment the contagion broke into this world. Each site of infection is defined both by the vector of the infection, as well as the site of its arrival. While there are many novel ways for khalkoi to enter this world, there is little ever stopping one from plane shifting directly to the local temple and beginning the massacre.

A creature infected with brain larvae dies when their head finally explodes, producing 1d4 khalkos spawn. Each khalkos spawn is ravenous, and it is always on the hunt. If the brain larvae host had an alignment trait, this khalkos grows at a fast rate. Otherwise, it has a 25% chance to grow at a medium rate; the rest grow at a slow rate.</p>\n<p>Adult khalkoi can inject a victim with brain larvae only once daily. Few creatures—even Celestials and Fiends—are immune to disease, much less one so pernicious as brain larvae.

As the infection gets worse, the traits of the khalkos ecology transform. What begins as a new, mysterious insect species quickly spirals out of control. Unless the khalkos conspiracy is squashed, it consumes this planet entirely—leaving only a hollowed-out hive.</p>\n<p>The stages of planetary infection are as follows. They cause the khalkos ecological zones to grow and transform. Starting at Stage 4, there are multiple hives; each hive has its own ecological Zones surrounding it.</p>\n<p>Multiverse scholars consider a planetary infection terminal at Stage 4. A planet with a Stage 7 infection is thoroughly dominated by the khalkoi, yet may feature the remnants of a resistance coalition. The growth rates on this chart assume a limited availability of cosmically aligned entities, such as on the Material Plane; the infection grows faster when contacting aligned planes such as Heaven, Hell, and the Abyss.</p>\n<p>Continents and planets reshaped by khalkos invasion require their own worldbuilding. The encounters in such a world are fundamentally different from the early- and mid- stages of planetary infection.

The khalkoi expect all creatures within their territory to serve either as servants, incubation hosts, or food—if not all the above! All others are pests and threats, fit only for destruction.</p>\n<p>The khalkoi have their parasitized servants evaluate intruders for their utility in each role. Those who do not obey the khalkoi’s enforcers are either dispatched and fed to the spawn, or they are captured for parasitization. The enforcers keep special lookout for Fiends and Celestials (including familiars), as well as for sages whose years of experience would be useful if fed to the next generation of khalkoi.</p>\n<p>The encounters in khalkos territory are defined by the nature of the hive (see Table: Lair Location). The specifics of the scenario may make multiple tables appropriate. The creature may be parasitized already, or held captive until it is time. The early stages of planetary infection may limit the khalkoi’s ability to acquire captives. At later stages, khalkoi hives can coordinate “sting” operations against high-value targets which are too powerful for a khalkos to defeat in fair combat.</p>\n<p>These tables do not represent premade

And while their powers imply they should have little difficulty with life on the run, khalkoi nonetheless find establishing a lair to be a most practical option, for it serves as a staging ground for their ongoing invasion. It is also a useful fortified location for resting and storing supplies.</p>\n<h3>Khalkos Hive</h3>\n<p>Khalkos invade any holy or unholy site, slowly transforming it into a hive. Yet they are open to any site that might readily supply cosmic energy. The one exception is underwater; adult khalkoi can explore underwater via alter self, but the spawn cannot cast it. Instead they ally themselves with aquatic forces of destruction (see Table: Khalkos Affiliates). The choice of hive informs its Zone 2 Minions and its Zone 3 Encounters.

Uses Urban Minions.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Khalkos Lair Features</h3>\n<p>The khalkos lair has the following features and considerations:</p>\n<p><strong>Feeding Chamber.</strong> At least one room is dedicated to storing food—whole corpses and animal carcasses— for consumption by wounded or juvenile khalkoi (see below). There may be as many as 1d6 juvenile khalkoi gorging themselves here at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Paper Prison.</strong> The khalkoi maintain a prison of captives ideal for incubating brain larvae. These prisoners are typically Fiends, Celestials, or Humanoids with an alignment trait. After subdual, prisoners are taken deep within the khalkos lair and imprisoned in a cocoon made from a thick leathery fibrous material (often called “paper”). The cocoon allows for no mobility. It has AC 15, 18 HP, and it has damage vulnerability to fire. After injecting the victim with brain larvae, the khalkos can remove the entire paper cocoon from the prisoner as an action.</p>\n<p><strong>Scent of Chaos.</strong> The air is pungent with the sick-sweet scent of Chaos Pheromones. Creatures who spend 1 minute in an area contaminated by lingering Chaos Pheromones must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature is confused for 1 round. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to Scent of Chaos for 24 hours. A creature that fails its saving throw is immune to Scent of Chaos for 1 minute. A creature immune to Chaos Pheromones is also immune to Scent of Chaos.</p>\n<p><strong>Temporospatial Anonymity. </strong>The khalkos lair and anything inside is warded by a perpetual nondetection effect (up to a 100-foot wide cube). Any khalkos which spends 8 hours or more within this effect also benefits from nondetection for 24 hours.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Khalkos Juvenile</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>As khalkoi spawn approach maturity, they enter a growth spurt and become especially ravenous. The khalkos spawn turns into a juvenile<span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">—and can do little more than eat and defend itself. If permitted only to eat, its juvenile stage lasts a mere 24 hours.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">A khalkos juvenile is a CR 4 (1,100 XP) Small-sized Aberration.

Each khalkos hive is overseen by at least one adult khalkos, and well- established hives are home to many. Each dispassionate khalos is none-the-less a heartless conspirator, always plotting and calculating how it might most efficiently exploit its minions and its surroundings.</p>\n<p>Khalkoi can be encountered in their lair or abroad, possibly alongside their parisitized victims (also see Khalkos Encounters, MoMe p. 293).</p>\n<h3>Setting the Scene</h3>\n<p>PCs of interest to the khalkoi will likely catch their attention well ahead of time, thanks to their psychic connection to their minions. They might arrive personally in order to investigate them or to parisitize one of them. A khalkos on reconnaissance is more likely to be caught off-guard, albeit in disguise (per <em>alter self</em>).<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Table: </strong>@UUID[RollTable.4jeuQgMeLiQCrNZy]{Khalkos' Location}</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:118px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:18.66%\"></col><col style=\"width:81.34%\"></col></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:16px\">1d4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:16px\">Location</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:17px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:17px\">The hive, attending to captives, juveniles, or the teleportation circle project</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:17px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:17px\">A nearby settlement, gathering information on local groups (disguised using alter self)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:17px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:17px\">Attempting to infiltrate a nearby faction (disguised using alter self)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:17px\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;height:17px\">Surveiling a threat or valuable target</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Table: </strong>@UUID[RollTable.Nbq448zxCcELGlz6]{Khalkos' Response}</p>\n<p>The khalkos’ response toward the PCs.
