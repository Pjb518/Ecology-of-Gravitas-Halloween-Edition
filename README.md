## [The Green Witch](https://bit.ly/3RNWBSE)

This free supplement spotlights the green hag, and how to make running this monster an exciting storyline well before initiative is even rolled! The tool features the following benefits:

- A drag-and-drop module suitable for any campaign (especially sandbox and published adventures)
- Encounter tables inspired by the green hag's ecology and lore, plus films and folklore
- Environmental traits for helping drive home the anxiety of being spied on by a witch
- Rumor and speculation tables for NPCs under the shadow of the green hag
- Role-playing advice for the green hag
- Advice on the green hag's minions, allies, and enemies
- Although designed for A5E, clever 5e GMs can also benefit from this module

Happy Halloween!
